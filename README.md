# Compiler Explorer CppCon Keynote 2017

This is the source to my presentation CppCon 2017. A few people asked how I put the slides together...this is it. 
Please don't laugh too hard at all the notes and intermediate steps I took along the way, though perhaps it will be
of interest to anyone wondering how the talk came about.
